# spiro
Very rudimentary implementation of the old Spirograph toy.  Draws a set of nested circles, from `0` to `2*pi`.  Each circle has a `frequency` and a `radius`

For example, this snippet of code

```
figure whatever
colour green
width 2
circle(1, 100)
circle(36, 10)
end
```

produces this image
